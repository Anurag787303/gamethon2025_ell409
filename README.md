## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Create a New Branch
For every new idea or modification, create a new branch from the `main` branch. Use descriptive branch names:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```
Examples:
- `idea1-data-driven-approach`
- `idea2-ml-model`
- `feedback-idea1`

### 3. Adding New Ideas
1. Navigate to the `ideas/` folder.
2. Create a new `.md` file with the name of your idea (e.g., `idea3.md`).
3. Write a detailed explanation of the idea, covering:
   - **Objective:** What the idea aims to achieve.
   - **Methodology:** Steps or methods (/algorithms) to implement it.
   - **Pros & Cons:** Strengths and weaknesses.
   - **Data Requirements:** Any specific data needs.
   - **Potential Challenges:** Anticipated hurdles.

### 4. Suggesting Feedback
1. Navigate to the `suggestions/` folder.
2. Locate the corresponding feedback file for the idea (e.g., `idea1_feedback.md`). If it doesn't exist, create one.
3. Add your feedback in a structured format:
   - **What works well:** List positive aspects.
   - **Areas of improvement:** Suggestions for enhancement.
   - **Additional comments:** Any other relevant thoughts.

### 5. Brainstorming Discussions
1. Use the `discussions/` folder to document brainstorming sessions.
2. Create a new file (e.g., `discussion1.md`) and include key points and insights.

### 6. Commit and Push Changes
After making changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<descriptive_message>"
git push origin <branch_name>
```
